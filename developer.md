#Developers

Just-A-Blog is designed for one purpose and that is blogging, using unneeded resources for those who want freedom from popular "Free blog" 
sites but, don't need the over-doing-it of wordpress. I am a supporter of wordpress, but I know for some it may be too much!

#Issues

When you create a issue, if you can put the line of code where you find it at. Not tech savy?  Its ok! Just take a screen shot if you get multiple errors
and if you don't just do your best to describe the problem. 

#Pull Requests!

Please be aware they are subject to disapproval, don't worry though! I will take consideration of all improvments!
